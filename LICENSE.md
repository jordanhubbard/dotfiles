The Klingon Software License (KSL)

*Version 1.0 - The Day of Honor Release*

By installing, copying, or otherwise using this software, you acknowledge that you have read this license, understood its spirit, and agreed to be bound by its terms, or face the consequences worthy of a dishonored Ferengi.

*The Warrior's Pledge*: You, the user, by the act of unleashing this software, join the ranks of the Klingon Empire's mightiest warriors. Your honor and courage will be tested through the trials of battle, debugging, and beyond.

*Honor in Battle*: This software is provided as is, without warranty of any kind. If it proves unworthy, may it die in battle as befits a true Klingon program. Your reliance upon it is at your own risk.

*No Peaceful Negotiations*: Redistribution, modification, and reverse engineering are permitted only if they enhance the software's combat effectiveness. Any attempt to weaken the software shall be seen as an act of cowardice and betrayal.

*Glory to the Empire*: You may distribute copies of the software to your allies, provided this license accompanies all copies. However, should your allies turn against the Empire, you shall be held responsible for their treachery.

*The Rite of Ascension*: Contributions to the software are welcome but will undergo rigorous scrutiny. Only the most worthy code shall become part of the software, elevating its status and honor.

*Fealty to the High Council*: This software may not be sold or used for profit without explicit permission from the High Council. To do so would be to invite dishonor upon your house.

*In the Event of Your Death*: Should you fall in battle (or at your keyboard), your rights under this license shall pass to your successor, provided they swear to uphold this license in your stead.

**Let it be known that by accepting this license, you pledge to uphold the values of the Klingon Empire: strength, honor, and the relentless pursuit of excellence. Failure to comply with these terms will result in immediate dishonor and a challenge to redeem your worth through combat or debugging, whichever proves more perilous.**

Qapla'!
